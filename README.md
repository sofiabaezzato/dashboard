# Dashboard - Greatbooks
![screenshot](./img/screenshot.png)

## main branch
This project involves creating a dashboard using HTML and CSS, with the primary goal of gaining hands-on experience with the `grid` layout and its associated properties. Throughout this assignment, my aim was not only to develop proficiency in utilizing `grid` but also to construct something personally meaningful. As a result, I decided to offer a sneak peek into my ultimate project aspiration: a social media platform tailored for book enthusiasts.

## interactive branch
I'm uncertain whether it adheres to best practices or if forking the repository would have been more appropriate, but I've taken the initiative to elevate the original front-end project to an interactive website. Feel free to explore it firsthand!

## Project Reflections

1. I have gained a comprehensive understanding of effectively utilizing `grid` and creating a naturally responsive webpage from scratch. I have minimized the reliance on media queries whenever possible.
2. One nice thing I noticed is that a few weeks ago, I was more engaged in trial and error, whereas now I approach my coding with greater intentionality and precision.
3. I've never cranked out this much JavaScript code before!
